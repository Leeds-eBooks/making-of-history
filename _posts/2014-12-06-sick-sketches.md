## Sick Sketches

Emperor Saga had 50 children (Minamoto); said to have lamented that the court nobility possessed few great and able men, whereas the cloisters abounded in them. Empress Tachibana too smokin' to teach people about Buddhism; orders her body tossed into the streets. ^This starts a new trend of documenting the decay of beautiful bodies via art.
