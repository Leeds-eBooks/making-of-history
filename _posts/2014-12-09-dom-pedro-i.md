He was apparently something of a dandy &#8211; bathed often in the Brazilian tradition, unlike his father

- sweetest stache ever  
- declared independence after his dad gave him a country &#8211; dick move at first glance, but he was actually instructed to do so by his father to maintain control of the country  
- after declaring independence, went back to Portugal to rule after his father died &#8211; nice.

&nbsp;

He wasn&#8217;t close to his parents anyway; his father was busy governing and his mother was deeply unhappy and detached. Letter he wrote:Â http://books.google.com/books?id=_\_0KrEZGkmUC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=dom+joao+dom+pedro+I&source=bl&ots=ZN1-nJ1CcM&sig=u4XvPpQmZy5xDb7JR-qcXbV2svY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=\_iDlU_nuEYH-yQTy04GYDg&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&q=dom%20joao%20dom%20pedro%20I&f=false

Poor Princess Leopoldina &#8211; she was very popular with the people of Brazil but Pedro found her dull and carried on a string of affairs. (if he saw a sedan chair being carried by slaves with the curtain closed, he&#8217;d ride up to take a peek then begin flirting if he liked what he saw &#8212; Ludovina Soares da Costa tricked him when he fell in love with her by inviting him to her house and then bringing him in to reveal the Royal Theater company, including her husband, so they could meet the prince &#8211;but that was before he married) Rumors that she died after he hit her; probably not true. As a result he had a hard time finding someone to marry afterward.
