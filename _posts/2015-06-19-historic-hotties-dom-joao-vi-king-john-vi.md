More Information & Sources

> Dom João VI / King John VI (May 13, 1767 - March 10, 1826 CE) governed Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves from 1792 - 1826. João’s mother, Queen Maria I, became unfit to rule in 1792 when she began having terrifying hallucinations (likely due to mixed porphyria), and João took over in her place. He officially became Prince Regent in 1799 and then King after Maria’s death in 1816. He is typically remembered as an indecisive but gentle ruler, who held daily “hand-kissing ceremonies” where his subjects of all classes and backgrounds could petition him for aid.

> João VI was famous for several quirks. He always referred to himself as “Your Majesty”. He loved roast chicken and would eat it with his hands, carrying it around in his stained pockets. He hated change. He always slept in the same spot and got upset if his furniture was moved -- he even hated to change his clothes, and wore them until they fell apart (his servants really did repair his clothes when he took naps). He was terrified of thunder and lightning, and of crabs. There is only one reference to him taking a bath during the thirteen years he spent in Brazil, and that was under doctor’s orders: a tick bite became infected, and João had a portable bath house constructed so he could be lowered into the ocean to bathe the wound in salt water (whether he was more afraid of encountering crabs or being seen naked is up for debate).

> João VI was not a particularly amorous person, so he may not have been all that interested in online dating (though there’s always the allure of finding that special someone who can appreciate greasy chicken pockets and rampant skin infections).

> João VI ruled during a troubled time in Portugal’s history. Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleon I) had taken over much of Europe but could not compete with Great Britain’s navy. Napoleon forced many European nations to close their ports to British trade, hoping to push his enemies into economic submission. João agreed to close Portugal’s ports in the Treaty of Badajoz (1801)  but never followed through. Instead, with the help of the British, João and his court escaped to the Brazilian colonies. In return, João opened Brazil’s ports to international trade for the first time. João did not return to Portugal until 1821.

> In Napoleon’s memoirs, he wrote that João was “the only one who tricked me.” General Andoche Junot (ambassador to the Portuguese court 1804-5 and leader of the French invasion in 1807) remembered João in a less flattering light -- when he met João, Junot exclaimed to his wife, “My God! How ugly he is!” Any way you slice it, João VI was a pretty memorable guy.
