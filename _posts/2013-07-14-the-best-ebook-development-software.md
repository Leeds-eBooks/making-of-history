It&#8217;s possibly presumptuous of me to describe the following list as &#8220;the best&#8221;. Really, the following programs are just &#8220;my favourite&#8221;. But I&#8217;ve shopped around and there are good reasons why these are brilliant. Any other recommendations? Please comment below!

Absolutely *perfect* text and code editor. Makes editing all the code documents you might find in an ebook &#8211; (x)html, css, xml, opf, ncx, js &#8211; a complete *dream*. And it&#8217;s essentially free, though I thoroughly recommend shelling out for the user license. Exemplary features: edit at multiple locations in the same document simultaneously, coloured code syntax for visual ease, a million other things&#8230;  
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/sigil/" title="Sigil" target="_blank"><img height="16px" width="16px" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2dNYqxkp9ds/UaiHiLh8nMI/AAAAAAAABKM/HOdCpHkXEog/s506-o/sigil.png" alt="Sigil" /> <strong>Sigil</strong></a>  
Frankly, I don&#8217;t think I could face ebook development without it. Automates lots of aspects of ebook creation: link and tag updates, table of contents creation, metadata input, everything really. And it&#8217;s 100% open source and free. Crazy not to.  
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" title="7-Zip" target="_blank"><img height="16px" width="16px" src="http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/5722/7zipoverlordsoftwaremg4.png" alt="7-Zip" /> <strong>7-Zip</strong></a>  
The last (un)zip software you&#8217;ll ever need. Unpacks/extracts &#8220;.epub&#8221; and &#8220;.mobi&#8221; files as well as any other compressed folder (&#8220;.zip&#8221;, &#8220;.rar&#8221; etc.), so you can have full access to edit any aspect of ebooks in either format.  
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000765261" title="Amazon Kindle Previewer" target="_blank"><img height="16px" width="16px" src="http://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/69661000/69661100/kindle-previewer-03-100x100.png" alt="Kindle Previewer" /> <strong>Kindle Previewer</strong></a>  
Something for which we can be grateful to Amazon. It allows you to test your Amazon ebooks on most Kindle devices and apps (although I&#8217;ve noticed some bugs in version 2.9 for iOS emulation &#8211; at the moment I&#8217;m relying on an iPad for iOS testing of &#8220;.mobi&#8221; ebooks). Can convert epub and html files to &#8220;.mobi&#8221;, and I also use it to re-pack &#8220;.mobi&#8221; ebooks that I&#8217;ve unpacked earlier using 7-Zip for editing.  
<a href="http://www.pagina-online.de/software/epub-checker/" title="Pagina EPUB-Checker" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.pagina-online.de/favicon.ico" alt="Pagina EPUB-Checker" /> <strong>EPUB-Checker</strong></a>  
There are several programs based on the IDPF&#8217;s <a href="http://validator.idpf.org/" title="IDPF Validator" target="_blank">epub validation tool</a>, this is probably the easiest to use. Drag-and-drop your epub ebook onto the open program, it tells you whether or not its code is valid.
