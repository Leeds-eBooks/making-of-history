### Empress Tachibana no Kachiko (橘嘉智子) (786-850 CE) was head-over-heels devoted to Buddhism. But writing a sappy song or tattooing “Siddhartha 4 ever” on her bicep was too mundane for this religious ruler. Instead, ambitious Kachiko decided to teach the people of Kyōto a morbid lesson from beyond the grave.


Empress Kachiko tried to teach Buddhist principles to everyone she met -- but her would-be students were too distracted by Kachiko’s beauty to listen. Every time the empress wanted to get cracking on some serious spiritual contemplation, she had to field catcalls and inappropriate suggestions from the men around her.

When Kachiko died at 64, she left an unusual will. Instead of asking for a royal funeral, a statue, or a nice commemorative park bench, Kachiko asked for her rotting corpse to be left lying in the street. The empress hoped that seeing her beautiful body develop a smell and be torn apart by wild animals would finally teach her people to think less of earthly pleasures.

So Kachiko’s body was dressed in simple robes and put on the streets of Kyōto, where it rotted away until only bone fragments were left. The spot became known as _Katabira no Tsuji_, the Crossroad of Corpses.
