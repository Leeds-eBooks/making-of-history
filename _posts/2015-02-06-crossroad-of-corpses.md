### Empress Tachibana no Kachiko (橘嘉智子) (786-850 CE) was head-over-heels devoted to Buddhism. But writing a sappy song or tattooing “Siddhartha 4 ever” on her bicep was too mundane for this religious ruler. Instead, ambitious Kachiko decided to teach the people of Kyōto a morbid lesson from beyond the grave.


Empress Kachiko tried to teach Buddhist principles to everyone she met -- but her would-be students were too distracted by Kachiko’s beauty to listen. Every time the empress wanted to get cracking on some serious spiritual contemplation, she had to field catcalls and inappropriate suggestions from the men around her.
