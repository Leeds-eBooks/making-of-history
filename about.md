![Ben Styles](/images/mugshot.jpg){: .mugshot}My name is Ben Styles. I make eBooks for independent presses and self-published authors, and websites and apps for artists, writers and creators. I am the programming and digital design half of kids&rsquo; app team [Robin &amp; his Birds](http://robinandhisbirds.com/), alongside illustrator and storyteller [Louise Bell](http://louisebell-artworks.tumblr.com/). I also work for the UK's leading publisher of poetry in translation, [Arc Publications](http://arcpublications.co.uk/). Employed at first as Editorial Assistant, I initiated the company's move into digital publishing.

My background is in languages and literature, giving me extensive experience in successful communication. I have a degree in English and Spanish and an MA in English Literature, both from the University of Leeds.
