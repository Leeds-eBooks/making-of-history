## Q: There are a lot of weird stories on this site. Are all of them are true?

Short Answer: Yes.

Long Answer: Well.... 

We all tell fibs, white lies, tall tales, and fish stories. And so did our grandparents, and their grandparents, and their grandparents, right up to the original lie (which was told by Ugg to Ugg Jr. when the caveboy asked where babies come from). Our ancestors lied to make themselves look better, to make their enemies seem more terrible, and just to liven things up when they were bored.

A historian’s job is to dig up the truth under the stories. Historians are like detectives in that way -- but all their star witnesses are liars. And dead. 

All of the content on this site is based on original sources and the opinions of qualified historians, so it’s all at least probably (mostly) true. The stories may be outlandish, but then whenever and wherever humans get involved things are bound to get weird.

If you disagree, you can always make us feel terrible about our poor life choices by e-mailing  us a stern message. 

## Q: Can I submit something?

Absolutely! If you have something that you’d like us to consider adding to the site, contact us at admin@makingofhistory.com . If your work is featured on the site, your name (and website/contact information, if desired) will be included on our ‘Contact’ or 'Art' pages.

Submission Guidelines:

All varieties of submissions are welcome. Write an article, create a cartoon or piece of art, write a historical poem or perform a historical rap. Anything goes, as long as your submission meets the following criteria:

1. All submissions must be your own work and must not use any copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise protected material. We are not fond of being sued (and we would have to pay our attorneys in instant noodle cups).

2. All submissions must include a detailed list of the sources for your research. And unfortunately, your main sources cannot be rare tomes from the tomb of Tutankhamun. If we can’t verify your facts, we won’t put them on the site.
