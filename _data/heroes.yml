# Here you can add images to the list from which the
# hero image (the big header on the homepage) is
# chosen. You need to be careful about the syntax â€“
# no extraneous spaces, returns or anything like that!
# On a new line, simply put a hyphen, followed by a
# space, followed by src:, a space, and the filename
# of the image. The filename can be a full URL to an
# image from another website, or the filename of an
# image in the "images" folder.
#
# NOTE: Unfortunately you can't start any of the
# entries with a quote character (" or ').
#
# NOTE: No accents in the src field!
