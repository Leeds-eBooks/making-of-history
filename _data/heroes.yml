# Here you can add images to the list from which the
# hero image (the big header on the homepage) is
# chosen. You need to be careful about the syntax â€“
# no extraneous spaces, returns or anything like that!
# On a new line, simply put a hyphen, followed by a
# space, followed by src:, a space, and the filename
# of the image surrounded by single quotes. The
# filename can be a full URL to an image from another
# website, or the filename of an image in the "images"
# folder. We also need the width and height of the
# image, in pixels. On a new line, put 2 spaces,
# followed by w:, a space, and then the width as a
# plain number, and then the height on the next line
# in the same way.
