# Here you can add images to the list from which the
# hero image (the big header on the homepage) is
# chosen. You need to be careful about the syntax â€“
# no extraneous spaces, returns or anything like that!
# On a new line, simply put a hyphen, followed by a
# space, followed by the filename of the image
# surrounded by single quotes. The filename can be
# a full URL to an image from another website, or
# the filename of an image in the "images" folder.
